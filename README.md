## RLHF-Blender UI

### Installation

The RLHF-Blender UI can be installed alongside the main [RLHF-Blender implementation](https://github.com/ymetz/rlhfblender) by following the instructions in the main repository.

### Standalone Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymetz/rlhfblender-ui.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd rlhfblender-ui
npm install

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Usage

The RLHF-Blender UI is a React application that can be used to interact with the RLHF-Blender python package. The UI is designed to be used in a browser and can be accessed via the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after starting the development server.
Additional guides to setup advanced interface (e.g. a local join setup via docker-compose or a remote setup in Kubernetes) is provided in the [main repository](https://github.com/ymetz/rlhfblender).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
